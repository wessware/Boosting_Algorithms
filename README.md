# Boosting_Algorithms

Algorithms that use boosting techniques to minimize the loss function for both classification and regression problems.

Due to the robustness and performance reputation of these models, we will use them to try and create a usable credit score for customers we intend to lend money to.

Attention will be paid to the training time and loss minimization for the models

## Models

For this project, we will primarily focus on two boosting algorithm; CatBoost and Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm.

### Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm

Trained on 80% of the dataset. 

#### Performance

Initial rmse scored 0.5179 [using binary:logistic as the loss function]
Score after Hyperparameter tuning 0.4685 [using binary:logistic as the loss function]
